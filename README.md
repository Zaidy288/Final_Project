# Software requirements

## System architecture
I will be using the MERN stack to do this application as that is what is the most easiest and what is required.
* As I will be using that stack, Express will be used to set the server up and run on a localhost so that it runs smoothly.
* React will be used to create how the app will work and function as it is used to make sure everything works properly.
* MongoDB will be used to save every task in the database, and to show them once they are called.

The deployment of the app will be on Heroku as it is the most reliable when it comes to deployment.

Create-react-app will be used for the front end as it does not only work with static sites, but dynamic ones too. If I were to use Next.js, it would not be correct.

Bootstrap and reactstrap will be used to style this project because of the easy to use code they provide. And that it looks more presentable that way.

## System requirements
### How it will work

This will be an application that allows students to track what courses they have to do from the main page. Here normal end-users may only be able to view the courses that are set up for them whereas a teacher (or someone who is an admin) can make, cancel or edit courses for the students.

### Similar sites

There are similar sites like these as universities use these to give projects to their students. With this one however, you wont have to pay thousands to access those sites, So this is the cheaper option.

### Functional requirements

* To allow a normal user to see the projects that were given to them
* To allow an admin (or someone that can sign in) to create, edit and delete tasks for their students

### Non-functional requirements

* For the website to be easy to use an access
* For everything to work smoothly and run efficiently
